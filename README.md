### Summary of the Code

The provided code implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to play the Snake game. It uses **Double DQN** and **Prioritized Experience Replay** techniques to enhance learning. The agent interacts with the Snake game environment, which is custom-built using **Pygame**, and trains itself through reinforcement learning by optimizing a neural network.

The key components of the code include:
1. Snake Game Environment: A custom implementation of the Snake game that provides states, rewards, and determines if the game has ended.
2. DQN Agent: A reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the game using a neural network (`Linear_QNet`) to approximate the Q-function.
3. Prioritized Experience Replay Buffer: Enhances the learning process by sampling experiences based on their importance.
4. Training and Visualization:
   - Training involves the agent playing multiple games, improving its policy using the DQN algorithm, and updating its target network periodically.
   - Visualization allows the user to see the trained agent playing the game.

### Libraries Used
1. PyTorch (`torch`): For building and training the neural network.
2. Pygame: For rendering and managing the Snake game environment.
3. Numpy: For numerical operations and handling prioritized sampling.
4. **Matplotlib**: For plotting the training progress (scores and mean scores).
5. **Collections**: For managing the replay buffer using a deque and defining the `Experience` named tuple.
6. **Random**: For random sampling during action selection and food placement.

The code provides two main functionalities:
- Training: Trains the DQN agent to play the Snake game.
- Visualization: Demonstrates the performance of the trained agent.
